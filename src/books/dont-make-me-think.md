- Usability went mainstream
- Like a lot of common sense, though, it’s not necessarily obvious until after someone’s pointed it out to you.
- I find that the most valuable contributions I make to each project always come from keeping just a few key usability principles in mind. 

Definition of Usability:

> A person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth.


## Guiding Principles

### 1. Don't Make Me Think

- Note that these things are always on a continuum somewhere between “Obvious to everybody” and “Truly obscure,” and there are always tradeoffs involved.
  - Perfer **obvious**.
- Make links, buttons obviously clickable.
- No question marks. No mental chatter. And no errors.
- Here’s the rule: If you can’t make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.

> “On a self-explanatory page, it takes a little thought to “get it”—but only a little. The appearance of things (like size, color, and layout), their well-chosen names, and the small amounts of carefully crafted text should all work together to create a sense of nearly effortless understanding.”

### 2. How we really use the Web

> “most people are going to spend far less time looking at the pages we design than we’d like to imagine.”

> “As a result, if Web pages are going to be effective, they have to work most of their magic at a glance. And the best way to do this is to create pages that are self-evident, or at least self-explanatory.”
