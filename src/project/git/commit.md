# Write Small Commit Message

- Getting early feedback from both tools (e.g. unit tests on a CI server) and other people (developers, testers, product managers) which encourages the idea of continuous improvement and helps to avoid large changes in the future.
- Revert a commit with ease if something goes wrong. Big commits are harder to revert since you may not want to revert all of the changes but only a subset.
- Small commits are easier to understand when reviewing a pull request.
- Write better commit messages. Since small commits are usually more focused and less broad than big commits, it is often easier to state the purpose of a small commit.
- Improve your statistics (donâ€™t take this too seriously).
